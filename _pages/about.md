Hi there! My name is Yujia Qin, I'm currently an undergraduate at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. At Tsinghua, I'm fortunately advised by Prof. Zhiyuan Liu. I was a summer intern at USC advised by Prof. Xiang Ren. My research interest is natural language processing, data mining, social computing and machine learning. I'm actively looking for Ph.D. positions in these fields this year!!!
