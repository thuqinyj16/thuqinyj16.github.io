  Hi there, welcome!
  My name is Yujia Qin, I'm currently a senior undergraduate at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. At Tsinghua, I'm fortunately advised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/index.html). Last summer, I worked as a summer intern at USC advised by [Prof. Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/). 
  My research interest lies in natural language processing, data mining, social computing and machine learning.
