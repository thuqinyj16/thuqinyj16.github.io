  Hi there, welcome! My name is Yujia Qin, I'm currently a senior undergraduate at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. At Tsinghua, I'm fortunately advised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/index.html). Last summer, I worked as a summer intern at USC advised by [Prof. Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/). 
  My research interest lies in natural language processing, data mining, social computing and machine learning.
  
Education
======
* B.E. Electronic Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, 2020 (expected)
* Minor: Center for Statistics, Tsinghua University

Research and Work Experience
======
What is the future of deep learning? While deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance, there are still three main challenges: (1) domain knowledge integration, (2) data insufficiency, and (3) model interpretability. Overly replying on computing power and human-created labels is not a good trend for deep learning. I believe knowledge-guided NLP is a solution to these challenges.

* Gave a talk at the 1st HowNet Seminar, CCL, 2019
* I participated in a three-week joint teaching support activity of Tsinghua in rural villages of China, it's a very unforgettable experience for me. (Huguan, Shanxi, July 2017)

Misc.
======
* Sport: I like playing basketball and badminton. I'm a huge fan of [Russell Westbrook](https://twitter.com/russwest44)
